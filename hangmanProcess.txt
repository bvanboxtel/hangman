OBJECTIVE:

This program will allow the user to play hangman against the computer using a list of fords from text file. 
-Function that randomly selects a word from the text dictionary
-Function that takes input from user which will be the letter guessed
-Function that will take the letters guessed correctly and turn these into a string
-Need to create various variables to store the users inputted data
    -Variable for the word that computer picks
    -Create a set of data that holds the letters guessed wrong and the letters guessed correctly by the user
-We need to displayan intro to the program
-Build a repetitive system, so that the user can keep guessing the letter
-If the user guesses wrong a new part for the body is drawn, until they losw (Guesses left goes down/ wrong guesses go up)
-Add statements to the end and beginning that welcome and thank the user for playing
